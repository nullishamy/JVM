# Kate

Kate is a JVM written in Rust, it's a passion project that aims to improve my
knowledge of systems development and JVM internals.

Contributions are welcome (see CONTRIBUTING.md). Check the issues for any
"up for grabs" issues.

This is still a very early stages project but documentation should be coming soon:tm:.
